        problems we face in engineering v. how chefs work

i love food.
lol line up & stand up.
working in kitchens taught me a lot of lessons.

in kitchens you are dealing with:
### shipping fast and shipping often

sense of urgency
"It goes beyond just making sure we are prepared and ready to serve. It's about speed, but it also means investing in what we do with importance. Great cooking is the accumulation of countless tiny tasks. Taken in isolation, these tasks might seem minimal. But each and every one of them is vital to the whole. And performing them with urgency heightens their significance even more."

Zoe Nathan, if it's not good, don't serve it. (reduces reputation with customers & your standards.)

Good teams of cooks have mastered the art of "perfectionism with happiness" bc they understand it's not about being "perfect", it's about getting to a point where you can't improve on it, where you've done the best you can do

### synchronized collaboration

psychological safety & trust

"Ultimately, I want to cultivate a space where people can think, assess, and ask questions when they don’t understand a technique or request. I try not to be overly disappointed in a way that makes someone feel bad. I try to teach from a place of compassion."–Cortney Burns, Bar Tartine




### executing within a design pattern

"Cooking is about two things... regardless of what level you're cooking at... It's all about product & execution." –Thomas Keller
(execution aka technique is our tech skills. product is languages. seasoning and gadgets are tools and frameworks.)
the only way to do this is to practice.
Developing your Palette - Experience running into things and recognizing them

"Out of this appetite for knowledge has come some really amazing results, techniques and cooking styles. And some of these will stay and become part of everyday cooking and some of them will go away, probably for the better. but regardless of which things do or don't catch on, what will remain is the knowledge that we've gained along the way, in the process. and what we will be left with, ultimately... are better cooks. that's really our goal, to make better cooks." –Wylie Dufresne

on technology in the kitchen. "When i started cooking the food processor did not exist. we didn't have cuisinarts (or) robocoupes. when we made a puree we had to put it in a (small) blender... or chop it, chop it, chop it and chop it and then pass it through sieves to make a puree."
in cooking we understand _why_ techniques are preferable

learning the science behind cooking --> cs theory
first you learn how, then you learn why. you learn it in this order bc there is too much to learn about the why, so you have to learn how first so that you can be educated on picking which "whys" you want to learn [César Vega's The Kitchen As Laboratory](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-do-you-cook-the-perfect-egg-87844887/?no-ist)

[transition from they why we don't do it this way to how we do it.]


### documenting our process

"Creating community wealth is the most effective way to achieve lasting social change." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table
"invest in your community. a business that understands how powerful it is to create wealth for the community stands a much higher chance of creating wealth for its own investors." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table

“Cookbooks are special to me, and I love peering into chef’s lives, sharing in their triumphs and failures and learning about their cuisines.”

–Ivan Orkin _Ivan Ramen_

“I’m a chef. I don’t really open a cookbook to cook from it, and I don’t know if many people do. I read cookbooks because I want to know why someone cooks the way they do, how they arrived at their recipes. It doesn’t matter if the recipe is complex—molecular, whatever—or a simple one. It could be a pancake recipe, but I want to know why the author’s excited about it.” –Ivan Orkin _Ivan Ramen_

### refactoring

our codebase is like a chef's mise. it's part of the challenge of programming on a team, the fact that someone else is going to step through your work.
"If you let your mise-en-place run down, get dirty and disorganized, you'll quickly find yourself spinning in place and calling for back-up. I worked with a chef who used to step behind the line to a dirty cook's station in the middle of the rush to explain why the offending cook was falling behind. He'd press his palm down on the cutting board, which was littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, breadcrumbs and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly on a station if not constantly wiped away with a moist side-towel. 'You see this?' he'd inquire, raising his palm so that the cook could see the bits of dirt and scraps sticking to his chef's palm, 'That's what the inside of your head looks like now. Work clean!'." –Anthony Bourdain _Kitchen Confidential_

“Thomas Keller then covers the container, stores it, cleans his knife, and wipes down his board so that it appears nothing at all has happened.”

if you aspire to be a lead engineer or architect, you need to be extra vigilant.

“On the way out he stopped to wipe crumbs off a cutting board used by the cheese station to slice bread, and in the parking lot he picked up a cigarette butt.
“Is the guest going to notice the cigarette butt in the driveway?” he asked me. “Consciously, no.” Eric seemed to be in part instructing me and in part playing the role of model French Laundry employee for my benefit. He said, “It’s all those unconscious things that make this a beautiful place.” But he was no doubt genuine. Keller was forever picking up cigarette butts himself. And I would warrant that if Keller had seen one of his cooks spot a butt and not pick it up, that cook would thereby have created an insurmountable barrier to advancement in the kitchen. Most of these cooks, Keller explained to me, hoped to own their own restaurants one day; if they were good enough for that, they would treat this place as if they were the owners. If they didn’t, they would never be successful, he thought, because you can’t spend half a career as someone else’s employee and then suddenly, one day, start thinking like an owner. If you wanted to be a great chef and restaurateur, you had to think like an owner and act like the owner from your very first job as prep cook, or you’d never develop the muscles for when the time actually arrived.” Michael Ruhlman _The Soul of a Chef_



### empathy
#### empathy for our team

On tempers “Keller was once well known for his temper. Many of the cooks who worked under him hated him. When one of his line cooks once complained about a late walk-in, Keller fired the cook on the spot. You want to go home, go home, Keller said. The young cook pleaded and pleaded. But fired means fired. Reminded about his early days, he says, “There comes a point when you’ve exhausted rational expression. And you’ve got to revert to more primitive means. But by then it’s too late anyway. So now he uses calmer means to convey his anger or disapproval. Silence can be more effective than a scream. And he will get angry in his kitchen, but I never heard him raise his voice. His anger is concentrated and focused.” Excerpt From: Michael Ruhlman. “The Soul of a Chef.” iBooks. ”Excerpt From: Michael Ruhlman. _The Soul of a Chef_

"the desire (to be the best), sometimes manifests itself as a kitchen full of yelling. i can tell you personally, that kind of kitchen space is where nobody wants to say anything, they're too scared. Any kind of creative process reaches a standstill. if there is (only) one totalitarian opinion in the kitchen, creativity withers. constructive criticism is a crucial ingredient in any good dish." –David Chang

"I used to go back and forth about whether i need to be more militant or more relaxed. But I've realized our restaurants work best when they're both, simultaneously. An environment where cooks have thick skin and a high level of empathy." –David Chang

#### empathy for our users

"servant leadership, as articulated by the late Robert Greenleaf. He believed that organizations are at their most effective when leaders encourage collaboration, trust, foresight, listening & empowerment. in any hierarchy, it's clear that the ultimate boss holds the most power, but a wonderful thing happens when you flip the traditional organizational chart upside down... my job (as the boss) is to serve and support the next layer 'above' me so that the people on that layer can then serve and suppoer the next layer 'above' them and so on. ultimately our cooks, servers, reservationists, coast checkers & dishwashers are then in the best possible position to serve our guests. you cannot have a dynamic organization unless you are constantly encouraging people to improve and believing that they can do it." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table

"the five A's for effectively addressing mistakes: awareness, acknowledgement, apology, action & additional generosity." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table
"make new mistakes everyday"

"A 51 percenter has five core emotional skills: optimistic warmth, intelligence, work ethic, empathy, self awareness & integrity." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table

"the excellence reflex is a natural reaction to fix something that isn't right, or to improve something that could be better. the excellence reflex is rooted in instinct and upbringing and then constantly honed through awareness, caring and practice." –Danny Meyer, Setting The Table

### farm to kitchen --> open source

in the USA, we code in the "california" of produce. we have access to produce that places like antartica can only dream of.

investing in your farmers means you'll have tools in the future that will allow you to create ever more inspired works.

“You read and you understand what’s going on around you in your environment, paying attention to your surroundings. And then you get world-class local products and use them seasonally. Your own vision will eventually come through.” –David Kinch _Manresa_

we cook with *underripe* languages (produce) bc we need frameworks (weird cooking tools & seasoning).

“Just touching the first tomato, I was compelled to taste it right away. The skin was so delicate, it was like holding a water balloon: I was afraid to grab it, so I gently cupped it in my hands in order to move it around. These tomatoes were truly ripe—I mean truly ripe. They’d reached a peak of physiological perfection not only of sugar, acid, and balance but also of maturity. They had been picked at the perfect time, not the most convenient. It was that obvious: warm from the sun, to be eaten like an apple, maybe with some salt—oil might be too much. It’s destined to go from garden to kitchen with nothing in between. I realized that so many of the tomatoes that I’d bought at markets and from my top suppliers were underripe (but delicious). True heirlooms require as much care to move as they do to grow. And that night, I realized just how much care and respect they required in order to pass them on to our guests.” –David Kinch _Manresa_

why we need to contribute to OSS
“Well,” I thought, “we’ll just grow our own produce.” Easy, right? I started looking at land for a small restaurant garden or farm and immediately realized I was in way over my head. So much work and dedication—it seemed even harder than the restaurant business. It was crazy to think we could do this on our own... It’s a partnership that compels us, as well as our respective teams, to be the best we can possibly be. It has involved growth, renovations, and relocations that neither of us could have imagined.” –David Kinch _Manresa_








    Good Habits
    [1] sense of urgency
    [1] if it's not good don't serve it
    [2] communicate constantly
    [2] teamwork & team pride
    [4] work clean
    [] respect ingredients
    [] don't fuck with my mise
    [] attention to detail
    [] cultivate your palate & your appetite
    when you start getting attention, you have to work twice as hard. hype means more users which means higher expectations.


----------------------------------------


on whiteboarding interviews
“In my experience, cooks are visual people. It has always been difficult for me to sit down with a piece of paper and write a menu. But if I hold an eggplant and imagine how it tastes, ideas come together. So it’s actually liberating to be able to go to the farm or step into the walk-in, and then see a dish in my mind and say, “I know how I’m going to use this.” Suddenly conceptualizing a dish is not thinking about a protein, two vegetables, and a sauce. It’s not choosing one from column A and one from column B.” –David Kinch _Manresa_


- obviously there are a lot of things, the restaurant industry is known for that we shouldn't emulate
  - yelling
  - militaristic iteration
  - misogyny
  - racism
  - harassment & inappropriate behavior
- though many chefs are working on improving these aspects of the job now that there is more interest in the industry

everytime i hear people touting opinions & taking it personally when a dish isn't great
"we aren't curing cancer"

we care deeply, we spend our spare time on personal cooking projects & get hard ons for our ingredients.  but at the end of the say, if chef wants it NOW, we ship. SENSE OF URGENCY

                it's important to remember that design should be about what's familiar.

Wylie Dufresne on Eggs Benedict "we take things that are familiar and present them in an unfamiliar way... eggs benedict means something to you, you have emotional ties, whether it means Sunday brunch or your mom making it for you... we want to take it and upend it but we don't want to mess with the spirit of it. when you put it in your mouth, and have eggs benedict the way you remember it." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBMqEeq2j6o at 19:45

                "And my experience, in Mexico City, is that the only way you can have good staff is if they’re involved in what you’re doing, and their lives benefit from working with you. Like, it makes sense for them on more than just the economical level." [Gabriela Camara](http://luckypeach.com/gabriela-camara-on-staffing-a-restaurant-in-san-francisco/)
                Good teams of cooks have mastered the art of "perfectionism with happiness" bc they understand it's not about being "perfect", it's about getting to a point where you can't improve on it, where you've done the best you can do
                supper clubs are our personal projects
                css is to programming as butter is to sauce. it enriches it, it makes it palatable




On working clean. Bourdain talks about how a chef will put his hand down on the cutting board of a cook who leaves a mess of remnants and tell him that that's what the inside of his brain is like. When you leave behind remnants, it sticks to the rest of your code and becomes harder and harder to get off. “Thomas Keller then covers the container, stores it, cleans his knife, and wipes down his board so that it appears nothing at all has happened. ”
hospitality is empathy
                Michael at Taco Maria & Chef's lesson of taking time to think “Under Keller, cooks learned the importance of moving slowly. If you were moving fast, something was wrong—you hadn’t planned well, you hadn’t been efficient—and your food would suffer. To move slowly was the goal, an element of the self-discipline you learned as you became a better cook.” Excerpt From: Michael Ruhlman. “The Soul of a Chef.” iBooks.

Treat it like it's yours & one day it will be. –Thomas Keller

"The real reason that i cook... is nurturing people. We try to do the best we can... but at the end of the day it's [all about] nurturing people in many different ways... Not just physically but emotionally as well. And then I realized it wasn't just about nurturing our guest... It's about nurturing ourselves and that experience in the kitchen... it's about the experience that we share with one another that compels us to continue to do what we do everyday. and it's not a job, it's a lifestyle." –Thomas Keller

opinions are like a chef's palate. we need to be objective about our opinions bc not everyone has the same taste as we do. be objective.
salting things is hard.
"as a chef you learn to salt to taste... you taste as you go and adjust seasoning, taste and adjust seasoning. eventually it becomes intuition. no one is born with it. you learn from overseasoning. you learn from underseasoning. my role as a chef now is not to provide the tools to measure exactly (to the milligram) i want to create that intuition... i think in that dichotomy they'll know what really great food is."–David Chang

“He liked the fact that all shallots here were chopped by hand and not pulsed in a Robot Coupe. When you chop shallots in a food processor (when I was a cook, I preferred this method . . . because it was faster), the cut is irregular, leaving you with some large chunks, some perfect, and the rest a shallot puree. Grant was even willing to concede that using a processor didn’t hurt the food. “It wouldn’t necessarily affect the food,” he said. “But it affects your psyche. If you take a half hour to chop shallots, you’re going to make sure they don’t get wasted.” Excerpt From: Michael Ruhlman _The Soul of a Chef_

“Butter, butter, butter, give me more butter” was one of his favorite quotations from the chef he most admired in history, Fernand Point. And every day the fish station cook would create fifteen or twenty pounds of what they called beurre monté. If you melt butter, its components separate; by starting with a little water, just a tablespoon or so, and whisking the butter into it one chunk at a time, you could keep those components together in an opaque yellow fluid that was pure whole butter.” Michael Ruhlman _The Soul of a Chef_

“If you’re cooking green vegetables, you might think it’s acceptable to throw the whole lot into a pan of boiling water. But you’re going to create a problem. The water immediately stops boiling, and now that the water is not so hot, the green pigment, chlorophyll, is killed off and the vegetable loses its brightness. Whereas cooking a small quantity of vegetables will keep the water at a boiling point and the vegetables will end up on the plate looking vibrant—and green.” Marco Pierre White _The Devil in the Kitchen_


talk *about* the article fantasies of a happier kitchen

                "A former chef I worked for always told me to explore other cultural activities on my days off—seeing a film, going to a museum, listening to a concert—since creativity breeds creativity."

                "At times, we need to learn to step back as much as we need to step forward."

"Negativity and abuse are not necessary aspects of kitchen culture—fear doesn’t always enhance productivity. But a little fear is not a bad thing. It means you really care about your craft. I’ve always trained in kitchens that didn’t tolerate abuse—I’ve been reprimanded, yes, but never abused. The times I’ve been reprimanded, I used the situation to motivate myself to work harder."
"Once, I’d been asked to concasse some beautiful tomatoes, but I didn’t fully understand the meaning at the time. Confronted by a mix of fear and pride, I hesitated to ask for an explanation and instead left the tomatoes in a pot of boiling water for too long. Upon returning and seeing the stewed tomatoes, my chef screamed at me. Trying to suppress my shame, I quickly turned the simmered, pulpy tomatoes into our staff meal. Now, I make a point of explaining terms very clearly to new cooks in my kitchen."
"The other time in which a mistake now dictates how I run my own kitchen happened at the end of a long service. I had been so eager to hang up my apron for the night that I wasn’t paying attention and ended up overcooking my lamb. I was about to plate it when the chef gave me a look of disappointment followed by a deep sigh: “You’re only as good as your last plate.” I still live by those words. Now, at the end of the night I pay especially close attention to the final tickets, making sure to remind my cooks how important those final dishes are to our guests overall dining experience."

##### Setting The Table, Danny Meyer

"I believe that anyone who is qualified for a job in our company is also qualified for many other jobs at the same pay scale. it's up to us to provide solid reasons for our employees to want to work for us, over and beyond their compensation."
"constant gentle pressure"
"fire is power... managers can use their fire as a torch: a light for guidance and teaching, and for leading and showing the way. they can use their fire to offer warmth and empathy, to make employees feel safe. a manager's fire can be used as a campfire, to form collegial bonds with employees, and to inspire others and help them grow. a fire can also be a bonfire to rally the troops, to foster team folklore, to get the group motivated, and to bring people together in a unified pursuit of a common goal. managers who inspire high levels of performance in their employees know how to produce magical results that leave people in awe. managers must be wizards - the way they 'breathe fire' is a source of motivation that impels employees to imitate them and to grow and managers must learn to use the fire in their own bellies as a way to fuel and refuel their own ongoing passion for this business. if leaders lack fire, why would anyone want to follow them? when managers use their fire improperly employees will always figure out ways to snuff it out. if a manager builds too many campfires, power may be compromised, causing the line between manager and employee to dissolve..." (such a long quotation)
