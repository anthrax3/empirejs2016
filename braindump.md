"we take things that are familiar and present them in an unfamiliar way... eggs benedict means something to you, you have emotional ties, whether it means sunday brunch or your mom making it for you... we want to take it and upend it but we don't want to mess with the spirit of it. when you put it in your mouth, and have eggs benedict the way you remember it."
