What Startups Can Learn From Chef Culture

## Abstract

Someone is breathing down your neck because the client wants the work done now. You prototyped an awesome menu only to find that the people at the top opted to replace it with the popular hamburger menu. And through all this you're struggling to shift the culture of your workplace away from the macho tough guy attitude that permeates the whole community. Sound like the startup life? Maybe so, but it's also the high-pressure world of fine dining. There is a lot the tech industry can learn from the restaurant industry about leadership, teamwork, hierarchy, community & iteration. With the help of Thomas Keller, Rene Redzepi, Anthony Bourdain & countless others who have redefined the cultural landscape of the kitchen, we'll delve into the good habits of great chefs to learn how we can be better developers, serve better products & foster a better startup culture.
